;;; --- The Flutter Classic: A Counter App -----------------------
;;; A straight transliteration from the Dart example Counter app
;;;
;;; Note that, unlike the Dart original, this is not one big widget.
;;; Each different widget below has its own build method and responds
;;; to a different setState.

;;; Here we override the usual sugared widgets that take common
;;; attributes such as :home and :body from a solo (implicit) child
;;; with widgets that work closer to the Flutter, and make the properties explicit.
